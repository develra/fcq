# Research Challenge 1: FCQ

## Overall Plan
* Answer warm up questions by implementing specialized solutions
* Generalize solutions into APIs
* Expand the example questions
* Build predictive models
* Demo to interested parties
* Next: Generalize to another dataset

#Warm up Questions

Which course(s) failed the most number of students?
Which department had the most significant improvement in instructor ratings in year 2013 (compared to 2012)?
Which year saw the largest drop (from the previous year) in total students taught among all the CS courses? 
Which department had seen the biggest reduction in the number of courses taught since 2010 (i.e., the majors are shrinking)?
How does the university’s average GPA change over the years, rise, steady, or fall?
Who (instructors) had the largest change in instructor rating between any two years?
Who (instructors) had taught the most number of courses?
Who (instructors) had taught the most number of students?
Who (instructors), with at least 100 students taught, are most generous in giving out good grades (most students receiving A’s)?
Who (instructors) had the highest instructor ratings when teaching a large couse (n>100) for the first time?
Who (instructors) had shown the most consistent pattern in making a course (previously taught by someone else) better in terms of course rating?
Which department is more aggressive in failing students?
Which department relies on lecturers the most (highest ratio of students taught across instructor types)?
Is teaching generally worse or better in Spring compared to Fall semesters, in terms of instructor rating and in terms of course rating?
What is the relationship between class size and course rating, positive or negative correlation? Is this correlation becoming stronger or weaker over the years?
Are there more or fewer “grad part-time instructors” over the years?
Does the average teaching load (# of students taught) for a typical lecturer increase or decrease over the years?
Which course saw the largest increase in workload in any given year?
What is the average change in instructor rating pre and post tenure (assistant professor → associate professor)?
What is the average change in course size  pre and post tenure?
Ian contributes 5 more
Michael contributes 5 more
Which classes have the largest number of students withdraw throughout the semester?
Which classes show strong signs of “weed out” behaviour? ((TotalDropped+TotalIncomplete+Total C- or below)/total enrolled) 
Which instructors with class size n>30 have the best rating across all classes taught?
Which classes with a size n>30 were most impacted by the instructor? (diff between InsturctorAvg and CourseAvg)
Which classes had the highest loyalty (low drop and withdrawal rates). 


##Specialized Solutions

### Goal:
Establish our baseline solutions to these “diff” problems.
Purposely limit ourselves to basic technologies to understand their capabilities and limitations

### Requirements:
Solutions should be implemented in pure Javascript (let’s get really good at it).
If a database is used, only MongoDB is allowed (don’t get too fancy here yet).
Output should be in JSON.

Generalization into APIs
Identify commonalities across solutions to extract reusable logics and utility components
Design reusable, decomposable, and expressive APIs
Expansion of Questions
Demonstrate a much richer set of questions that can be answered by the APIs

Predictive Models
Come up with interesting predictive questions in the form of “how does X predict changes in Y?” (e.g., how does this year’s class size predict a department’s increase or decrease in the number of lecturers employed?)

Mike Skirpan will come up with more questions here
